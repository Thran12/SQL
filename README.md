Within the same or other country, there also exist a company who wants to collaborate with that company but they didnot know whether that company is scam or not. If the company does all sort of billings and taxing then thats a win company to get in trade with.So to know whether the company is not a scam, the companies will check whether the other company has tax identification number associated with it.So user company will give us details of company name ,city ,state or some other information and we will look for its id number in our database.
